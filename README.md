## 💡 Introduction
Machine learning competitions are the Formula 1 of data science — high stakes, high speed, and high innovation. Whether you’re climbing your first public leaderboard or aiming for a Grandmaster title, this list will help you:

Learn faster with curated tutorials

Code smarter using proven templates

Think sharper with battle-tested strategies

Stay motivated by following champions

## 🚀 Getting Started
If you’re new:

Create accounts on Kaggle, DrivenData, AIcrowd.

Complete the Titanic Kaggle challenge (classic starter).

Learn Python data science stack: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Understand train/validation/test splits and cross-validation.

## 📚 Core Resources
Tutorials & Courses

## 🧠 Techniques & Strategies
Feature Engineering
Target encoding for categorical variables

Date/time decomposition (day, week, season)

Text feature extraction (TF-IDF, embeddings)

Image augmentations (flip, crop, color jitter)

## Modeling Tricks
LightGBM/XGBoost/CatBoost parameter tuning

Neural nets with learning rate schedulers

Model stacking & blending

## Ensembling
Weighted averages of models

Stacking with meta-learners

Bagging multiple seeds

## Validation Strategies
K-Fold cross-validation

GroupKFold (for grouped data)

TimeSeriesSplit (for temporal competitions)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
Optuna – Hyperparameter optimization

Weights & Biases – Experiment tracking

Albumentations – Fast image augmentation

Shap – Model explainability

## 🏁 Leaderboard Psychology
Don’t chase the public leaderboard too early

Keep a “private” validation mindset

Beware of overfitting to the competition metric

Save code + environment for reproducibility
